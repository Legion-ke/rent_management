ABSTRACT
The research proposal aims to create a Rental Management System for real estate industry. This system will provide a much easier way for landlords or cooperation owning residential properties be able to keep records of rent payment, tenant maintenance  submission and generate reports much easily using modern technology. This system will include a database top store data, Mpesa integration to allow tenants pay directly using the system. This system will take approximately  13 weeks to develop and full stack web development tools: React for UI, Daraja API for Mpesa Integration and mongo db for database. 
CHAPTER ONE: RESEARCH INTRODUCTION
1.1	Research problem
The current rental process requires tenants to physically visit rental companies or landlords, which can be time-consuming and wasteful. Additionally, there is a lack of secure online payment methods with authentication and inadequate property specifications details.

1.2	Research Objectives
1.2.1	General Objective
i.	Develop a rent management platform.
1.2.2	Specific Objectives
a.	To implement  a database for the platform to store rental records.
b.	To create a secure payment option for tenants.
c.	To create a virtual showroom for available properties.
d.	To create Tenant Relations Management.
e.	To create a platform where tenants can request for maintenance.

1.3	Background Information
Most landlords use property agents who go door to door to confirm payments which sometimes may cause inconvenience to the tenants as they feel it is an invasion of their privacy. Sometimes the property agent may act in ways that do not reflect the wishes of the landlord. This system will eliminate the need for property agent. 


1.4	Study Justification
The aim of this project is to create a system that will be able to benefit those who own property and also organizations which have investors owning properties as a group. The system will be able to register tenants and give them a platform where they will be able to pay their rent without the hustle of going to banks and tellers. The property owner on the other hand has access to a system that  can enhance their interactions with their tenants. Groups can be able to track their investment through reports generated through the admin in real-time. 

1.5	Problem Scope

Inefficient Rental Process: The current rental process requires physical visits from rental companies , Property agents and  landlords, leading to time wastage , invasion of privacy and  inconvenience for both tenants and landlords
1.	Lack of Secure Online Payment Methods: The absence of a secure online payment method with authentication poses a challenge for tenants in making rent payments, leading to potential delays and security concerns.
2.	Inadequate Property Specifications Information: The current system lacks detailed property specifications, making it difficult for tenants to make informed decisions about renting properties.
3.	Property Advertisement and Lead Generation: Challenges related to property advertisement and lead generation, as well as the need to attract and retain suitable tenants, are crucial aspects of the rental management process.
4.	Communication Gaps and Lack of Automation: Communication gaps between tenants and landlords, as well as the absence of automation in rental processes, can lead to inefficiencies and misunderstandings 

 
CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter takes a look at the problem of the current rental system. It looks closely at the disadvantages of the physical rent payment and verification of payment for both owners and tenants,the technological preferences,reviews and key features to technological approach to the solutions of this problem. The solution are well represented by up-to-date studies from various  educational sources.


2.2 System Overview
This system will provide an interface to tenants where they will be able to make payments directly,order repair and maintenance and file complaints. The proposed system will enhance the use of information communication technology as according to Adebayo, FA., (2018) who gives a clear indication on the usage and the challenges of information communication technology. The proposed system seeks to provide users with a login interface that they will use to key in usernames and passwords so as to access their personal information. Through this, the proposed system will improve on security which will record a vast improvement as compared to other systems which are less secure to personal data. Kivwa, T., (2012) focuses on the challenges in the development and implementation of rental systems. The proposed system will implement sms integration  to notify the users on the relevant information pertaining each user. As from the other rental system, notification measures have not been enhanced. 

2.3 Features of the System
•	SMS integration
This System uses sms to alert tenants whenever the rent date is due,successful payment and any other alerts like water shortage date or repair dates.
•	Secure Payment Integration
Using modern payment solutions such as Mpesa business services to allow secure payment and storage of payments for future reference
•	Chat Integration 
Developing a platform where users can share their thoughts with the property owner such as complaints ,arrange for repair or maintenance or even report crimes/misconduct. Also they can communicate with other tenants for conflict resolution.
•	Report generation
Property owners are able to generate reports on profits,losses and any other expenses they may need to make decisions.
•	Virtual showroom
Creation of a virtual showroom to showcase empty properties to potential tenants which enhance the urge for clients to rent their properties. 

2.4 Existing Related Systems, and their Significant Features
Upangaji rental management system
Upangaji rental management system is designed to manage rental houses .it was designed in the early 1990s using Microsoft excel and still in use to date.. It does not offer integration of online payment systems.
Features
1.	Records are  paper trail
2.	Records are physical

2.5 Application Areas
This System is designed for both single property owners and organization property management cooperation.
The main focus of this system is to allow property owners manage their residential properties without hustle and their customer give them feedback 
2.6 Existing Languages, Tools and Frameworks that have been used to Develop …(the system topic)…
Since Upangaji uses the office suite(Microsoft excel) to store their data hence it it is spreadsheet model 
CHAPTER THREE: CONCLUSION
This proposed rent management system aims to revolutionize the rental process by offering a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly solution for both landlords and tenants. By implementing this system, we believe that we can significantly improve the rental experience for all parties involved.
